Button presses are detected and handled:
- Button 6 acts as a "modifier" that needs to be held for other actions.
- Button 7 with Button 6 held toggles power on/off.
- Button releases are monitored for Button 6.
- D-pad movements with Button 6 held adjust brightness and color.
The program waits 20 milliseconds between cycles.
